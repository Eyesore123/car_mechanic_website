# A website for a car mechanic workshop.

This is the first website I created that was hosted on a shared hosting service. It looks disgusting but a little better on phone screen.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a simple website for a car mechanic workshop.

On the backend I used PHP for form submission but then switched to using Formspree after having troubles with ports and stuff. My hosting service provider didn't have support for Node.js. I first created a backend with that but couldn't use it. Currently submit_form.php file handles the redirect after Formspree first handles the form submission. I've included server files for PHP and Node.js inside "Server files for node and php" folder. PHP works out of the box, but Node.js backend solution requires some additional setup with the files that are included. I remember how hard it was for a noob to wrestle with backend and trying to get the contact form to work. Not to mention how troublesome it was to learn about backend folder structure, learn how to hide files from public directory, set up routes and fetch the keys securely with this and that middleware. I've always felt horror towards backend ever since. I notice that I even wrote the .htaccess file without dot so it was doing nothing. :) Mistakes were made but that is the price of learning.

I changed some of the file formats and urls so you can still take a look at the pages that are deployed on github pages. And if you want to see how much this website changed after an upgrade, you can take a look at the upgraded website:
